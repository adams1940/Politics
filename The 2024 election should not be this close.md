Quoting Judge Michael Luttig, a federal judge appointed by George H.W. Bush
> We Americans live in faith with our Constitution and with the past generations of Americans who swore to protect it and fought to defend it. One week from today, we will decide whether Donald Trump is fit to be president of the United States again. He is not. When we entrusted our Constitution and our democracy to him before, he betrayed us. Campaigning for the presidency again, he now promises [to exact vengeance](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/15/us/politics/trump-opponents-enemy-within.html) against his fellow Americans whom he deems “the enemy from within,” those who have dared to challenge his betrayal, an enemies list that includes Republicans and Democrats alike.
> 
> There could be no higher duty of American citizenship than to decisively repudiate a man who betrayed the nation when he was previously entrusted with the highest office in the land and now threatens the persecution of American citizens who have crossed him. In the almost 250 years since the founding of the nation, no president before Donald Trump has ever so betrayed America.
> 
> This is not a difficult decision for voters, though my fellow Republicans and conservatives will finally have to decide what they have long hoped they would never have to decide — whether to put their country above their party. Republicans and conservatives have always proudly claimed they would be the first to put the country above all else when the time came. That time has come. If Republicans are unwilling to put America before their party now, they will never do so. They must be honest with themselves.

I am horrified by this election because I see the prospect of a Trump victory as an undeniable threat to everything that has made this country great. He has brought out the absolute worst in this country. He normalized authoritarianism and everything undemocratic, and saw how the weaknesses of this country can be exploited for his own personal gain. Although Kamala Harris has her own flaws, as does the Democratic party, they do not eat at the foundations of this country like Trump and this transformed Republican party. My goal in all of this is to convince you that voting for Kamala Harris is the right thing to do. I understand that this would be uncomfortable for you because of political disagreements, but understand that this comes from a place of reason and love for this country. If this election was hypothetically between Trump and Mitt Romney, I would be *just* as invested in convincing people to vote for Romney. 

What follows is an attempt to convince you that Trump *really is* that bad... that he is as un-American as it gets, that this election truly is a choice between Autocracy and Democracy, and that Kamala Harris is the only patriotic choice.



# In every conceivable aspect, Trump is unfit
## Trump is deeply morally flawed. And yes, that matters.
---
I want to double down on something that I've brought up before, and that is the rhetoric that Trump uses surrounding legall and illegal immigrants. What he says about these people is **absolutely** abhorrent. It is not about recognizing a problem - it is about exploiting a problem to the extreme for his own benefit. He actively stokes fear and hatred, and it is deplorable to play into that hand. I do not need to bring up the heaping pile of examples of Trump referring to immigrants in dehumanizing ways, but I will remind you of this. At a rally less than a year ago, he said that they are "poisoning the blood of our nation".  He has repeatedly talked about their flawed genetics, and I need to be absolutely clear that anybody who says that sort of thing should be kept as far from power as possible. We must stand up against this. If Trump loses, another will pick this language up. This must be actively fought. Recognize how deeply wrong that is, and what historically happens when leaders talk like this. This cannot be accepted.

Trump's rhetoric around immigrants, especially when he dehumanizes them or claims that they are genetically inferior, is deeply troubling to me - but even more so is how strongly this resonates with people. For many people, the way he talks isn't recognized as a reflection of how some of the most evil people in history have talked. It's like the population isn't aware of what happens when we start blaming immigrants for all of our problems. It's as if this evil language is an indication that only he is serious about immigration. Not to mention the fact that he would rather have an illegal immigration problem to use as leverage. 

But Trump's lack of moral backbone extends way beyond that. He has been found criminally liable for sexual assault, and **dozens** of women have described being assaulted and raped by him. And his response is always to dehumanize them, saying for example that that those women were too ugly to rape. Demeaning women is one of his trademarks, as if that makes him a real man. When the Access Hollywood tape was leaked, with him *bragging* about how he sexually assaults women, it was dismissed as locker room talk. He was known to hang out with Jeffery Epstein, the serial child rapist, and when being asked about declassifying information, he was open to everything mentioned but hesitated with Epstein's records. If this was anyone else, you'd have people saying he should get the chair. If this was a family member, you would have cut them off. But since it's Trump we just dismiss it as "boys will be boys". 

Trump's moral failings are not isolated incidents but a persistent pattern that goes far beyond isolated rhetoric or personal controversies. His willingness to lie without hesitation, often repeating falsehoods even after they've been publicly debunked, reflects a deeper disregard for truth and honesty. Whether it's about the size of his inauguration crowd, the legitimacy of an election, or the outcome of policy decisions, he manipulates facts to fit his narrative, often doubling down when challenged, creating a world of "alternative facts". This isn't just political posturing—it's a calculated effort to create a reality that serves his interests, even at the cost of public trust and the integrity of democratic institutions. A leader who consistently prioritizes personal gain over truth has no moral center.

Trump's business practices reveal a similar disregard for ethical standards. His long history of shady dealings, bankruptcies, and failure to pay contractors shows a man who is willing to exploit others for personal profit. His university, which scammed students out of thousands of dollars with false promises, is just one example of how he leverages his power to enrich himself while others suffer the consequences. This pattern of behavior isn't about smart business—it's about a man who consistently fails to operate in good faith, showing little concern for the well-being of others.

Trump's encouragement of political violence is another indicator of his moral shortcomings. He has repeatedly used his platform to encourage hostility against opponents, journalists, and even private citizens who challenge him. When his supporters engage in violence, he downplays or excuses it, often portraying them as patriots defending a noble cause. His refusal to categorically denounce white supremacist groups or far-right extremists, instead suggesting there were "very fine people on both sides" during the Charlottesville rally, highlights his willingness to stoke division and hatred for political gain. This kind of rhetoric endangers lives and frays the fabric of a diverse and democratic society.

From a practical standpoint, moral integrity in leadership matters because it shapes the values of a nation. Leaders set the tone for acceptable behavior, and when they consistently act without principle, they encourage others to do the same. A president's words and actions are more than just sound bites; they guide the cultural and ethical compass of a country. When we lower our standards for those in power, we risk normalizing dishonesty, cruelty, and corruption. ==Demanding higher morals in our leaders isn't about perfection—it's about expecting the basic decency, empathy, and commitment to truth that should be a minimum requirement for anyone aspiring to hold the highest office in the land.== Without these standards, we leave ourselves vulnerable to manipulation and exploitation by those who would put their interests above the common good.

## He is nothing more than a celebrity con man
---
Donald Trump’s life has been marked not by the achievements of a skilled businessman, but by a trail of fraud, cons, and broken promises that reveal a pattern of deception. Before he entered politics, Trump was already infamous for his fraudulent ventures, bankruptcies, and manipulations. His projects—from Trump University to his real estate dealings—often left investors, contractors, and ordinary Americans in financial ruin while he pocketed millions. Trump University, for example, was marketed as a premier real estate education program, promising insider knowledge to anyone willing to pay. In reality, it was a glorified sales pitch that misled students and gave them no valuable education, ultimately ending in a $25 million settlement for defrauding consumers.

Trump’s real estate empire is similarly built on shaky foundations. While he projects an image of immense wealth and success, his business practices reveal a different story. Time and again, he used bankruptcy as a tool to walk away from failed projects, often leaving employees, contractors, and smaller investors to shoulder the financial burden. His Atlantic City casinos, which he touted as world-class investments, went bankrupt multiple times, costing thousands of jobs and leaving investors empty-handed while Trump shielded his own assets. He has repeatedly demonstrated a willingness to exploit loopholes and manipulate legal systems to protect his own wealth, even if it meant others would lose everything.

Moreover, Trump’s questionable practices continued even as he gained celebrity status, manipulating his brand to create an illusion of success. His public persona as a “self-made billionaire” is largely a myth—he inherited substantial wealth from his father and used aggressive tax avoidance schemes to preserve his assets. Investigations have revealed years of tax fraud and financial manipulation, underscoring a pattern of deceit that runs deep in his business history. His inflated claims about his net worth and exaggerated successes reflect the mindset of a con man who prioritizes image over substance, willing to deceive the public to build his brand without real accomplishments to back it up.

So, in 2016 he lied and conned his way to the White House. This is all he ever was, and all he is. There is no genius or principled person behind this image. There is nothing but a scam of a man. When he won in 2016, even *he* didn't expect it. But he made no attempt to take it seriously. People who worked closely with him during those years repeatedly characterized him as a man-child with a grade-school level of intelligence and understanding of the world.

## Trump actively stokes division for his benefit, and brings out the worst in us
---
Donald Trump has shown a pattern of using divisive rhetoric and stoking resentment to further his political career and consolidate his support base. Rather than seeking to bridge divides or unify the country, he has often exploited existing tensions, amplifying them for his own gain. His approach has involved vilifying those who disagree with him, casting political opponents as enemies of the state, and labeling critical media as “fake news.” By creating an “us versus them” mentality, he has fostered an environment where loyalty to him supersedes loyalty to democratic principles or even to basic civility. This calculated approach to division has fractured the country, inflaming anger and distrust in ways that have long-lasting and damaging effects on our national fabric.

In moments where past presidents have called for unity and calm, Trump has instead turned to inflammatory language, seemingly more concerned with preserving his base’s loyalty than promoting national solidarity. He has used crises—whether protests, public health challenges, or international conflicts—as opportunities to provoke fear and rage, often targeting specific groups or demographics. His remarks following incidents of social unrest have often focused on disparaging particular communities or political movements rather than encouraging healing or understanding. This behavior is not only irresponsible but also dangerous, as it emboldens extremist voices and leads to increased division and hostility between Americans.

Furthermore, Trump’s language and behavior have lowered the standard of public discourse. He has made personal attacks, crude insults, and inflammatory conspiracy theories a regular feature of his communication, which has in turn normalized this behavior across parts of the country. Rather than setting an example as a leader for constructive dialogue, he has encouraged a form of political tribalism that thrives on anger and suspicion. This has not only damaged the country’s political climate but has also permeated communities and relationships, leaving us more divided, mistrustful, and quick to view fellow citizens as adversaries rather than as members of a shared society.

Ultimately, Trump’s focus on division is not accidental; it is a calculated strategy to mobilize his most loyal followers and position himself as their champion against a perceived “elite” or “enemy” class. This approach has succeeded in energizing his base, but at the cost of the country’s unity and civility. The role of a president is to uplift, inspire, and unite, especially in challenging times. By contrast, Trump’s approach has eroded these ideals, bringing out the worst instincts—fear, resentment, and suspicion—rather than fostering the qualities that make America strong. His legacy of division not only risks further polarization but also undermines the democratic values of respect, dialogue, and compromise that are essential to a functioning society.

## Trump is unprincipled, immature, and tempermental
---
Donald Trump’s actions have repeatedly shown a lack of guiding principles or consistent values. Trump's National Security Advisor John Bolton famously observed that Trump’s decisions seemed to have “no guiding principles, no strategy, and no real understanding of the issues.” His approach to policy and governance has often appeared to be reactionary and impulsive, with little concern for long-term consequences or ethical considerations. Trump’s focus has typically been on personal loyalty and short-term wins rather than grounded policies or moral consistency, leaving his administration to operate with an unsettling level of unpredictability.

This lack of principle and consistency has made Trump vulnerable to influence, as even his own allies and foreign adversaries have recognized. Russian President Vladimir Putin, for instance, reportedly described Trump as “malleable,” suggesting that he could be easily manipulated by flattery or the promise of loyalty. This characterization has been echoed by others, who have noted that Trump is often swayed by the last person to speak to him, regardless of their qualifications or expertise. Such malleability is particularly dangerous for someone in the highest office, as it allows both domestic advisors and foreign leaders to steer his decisions, not based on the best interests of the country but on the whims and impulses of the moment.

When selecting someone for the most powerful office in the country, these traits should be disqualifying. A president’s decisions impact millions of lives, and it is essential that the person making them has a steady temperament, a grounded sense of purpose, and a clear set of principles. Trump’s impulsiveness, lack of self-control, and apparent disinterest in cultivating a mature, consistent approach to leadership leave him unsuited for this role. The office of the president requires someone with the stoicism and resolve to face difficult situations with a clear head and steady hand—qualities Trump has shown, time and again, that he lacks. His focus on personal loyalty over principle and his reactionary decision-making are not only flaws but potential risks to the stability and security of the nation.

## Trump has terrible policy stances
---
A common, but ludicrous stance that people often take is that they can excuse all of the bad about Trump because he has such amazing policy stances. This usually goes hand-in-hand with labelling Biden-Harris policies as utter failures or even "socialist" or "communist" - which does nothing more than demonstrate people don't know what those words mean. Here, I will briefly dismantle a few myths about Trump's policies, but I want to be clear that even *if* he had great policy stances, it would still be deeply important to prevent him from gaining power.

It should come as no surprise that someone without principles, maturity, patience, and so on, is not capable of understanding the complexities of government, economics, international relations, etc. There is a myth that he would surround himself with the best advisors and listen to them, but those very people described the reality much differently; his more radical or impulsive instincts were regularly tempered by key figures within his administration, often through direct defiance, delaying tactics, or simply refusing to carry out his orders. Instead of heeding advice, he stubbornly relied on his childish and uniformed gut feelings, and repeatedly would state that he wished he had "generals like Hitler" who would just follow his orders no matter what.

Trump’s economic policies, especially his use of tariffs to force industrial revitalization, were both simplistic and counterproductive. The idea that imposing tariffs on China would somehow restore American manufacturing was not only economically naive but also devastating to many sectors of the U.S. economy. The trade war he initiated had the opposite of its intended effect: it disrupted supply chains, raised costs for American consumers and businesses, and led to retaliatory tariffs that hurt U.S. farmers, forcing the government to step in with billions in subsidies to keep them afloat. In contrast, the Biden administration has taken a more sophisticated approach to rebuilding American industry. Instead of blunt-force tariffs, Biden’s policies focus on strategic investments in infrastructure, clean energy, and advanced manufacturing. The Infrastructure Bill, for instance, has allocated significant resources to upgrade roads, bridges, and broadband—creating jobs and improving competitiveness in a way that benefits Americans directly. The Inflation Reduction Act is aimed at modernizing the U.S. economy through investments in green technology, which are designed to stimulate innovation and position the U.S. as a global leader in clean energy, rather than relying on punitive measures that have proven to be a drag on the economy.

Many potential Trump voters are probably unaware of what’s in store and imagine that Trump would just snap his fingers and “fix” what he insists is a terrible economy. The reality, however, is that America’s economic performance under the Biden-Harris administration has been very good, especially compared with that of other countries. We’ve [grown much faster](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Picture2_322474.png) than any other major wealthy nation, and we’ve substantially [outperformed projections](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/10.20.24-GDP.png), both those made before Covid-19 struck and those made at the beginning of the Biden administration. This achievement, says The Wall Street Journal, is “[remarkable](https://www.wsj.com/economy/the-next-president-inherits-a-remarkable-economy-7be2d059)”; The Economist calls it “[glorious](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/10/27/americas-glorious-economy-should-help-kamala-harris).” Neither is what you’d call a left-wing rag. "Whoever wins the White House next week will take office with no shortage of challenges, but at least one huge asset: an economy that is putting its peers to shame. With another solid performance in the [third quarter](https://www.wsj.com/economy/us-gdp-economy-third-quarter-2024-59bf100b?mod=article_inline), the U.S. has grown 2.7% over the past year. It is outrunning every other major developed economy, not to mention its own historical growth rate." The Economist hails the US economy as "The envy of the world". Do not be fooled by Trump - he is a celebrity con man, **not** a genius businessman with nuanced understanding of the economy.

Trump’s “America First” policy also failed to address the deeper, systemic challenges facing American industry. His tariff-based strategy was a Band-Aid on a larger problem of global competitiveness, and he provided no long-term vision for sustainable economic growth. Biden, on the other hand, has pursued a comprehensive strategy, highlighted by the CHIPS Act, to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the U.S. and decrease dependence on foreign supply chains. Biden's focus on public investment in innovation contrasts sharply with Trump’s reactionary measures that often seemed more about settling political scores than creating lasting economic gains.

In the realm of foreign policy, Trump’s decision-making was consistently driven by personal grievances and a desire to dismantle the achievements of his predecessors. His abrupt withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal was widely condemned as a reckless move that destabilized the region and alienated key allies. This decision was not based on a coherent strategy but rather seemed motivated by an obsession with undoing one of President Obama’s most significant diplomatic achievements. The Biden administration, in contrast, has sought to restore credibility on the global stage, re-engaging with allies and working to rebuild trust through diplomatic channels, even when confronting adversaries. The contrast between Trump's unilateral and impulsive withdrawals—like his decision to pull out of the Paris Climate Agreement—and Biden's emphasis on international cooperation could not be clearer. Under Biden, the U.S. has rejoined the Paris accords and has taken the lead in global climate initiatives, recognizing that America’s long-term interests are best served through multilateral engagement and forward-looking policies.

Trump’s foreign policy often blurred the line between national interest and personal interest. His attacks on NATO, his admiration for authoritarian leaders, and his transactional approach to alliances reflected a view of international relations that was short-term and self-centered. Instead of bolstering America’s standing, his approach often left the U.S. isolated, unpredictable, and untrustworthy. In contrast, the Biden administration has taken a more traditional approach to diplomacy, emphasizing the value of alliances, democratic values, and shared goals. This strategy has led to renewed cooperation with allies on everything from economic policy to security, bolstering American influence rather than squandering it.

The pattern in Trump’s decision-making is clear: rather than acting in the best interests of the nation, his policies were often driven by ego, personal vendettas, and a desire to claim symbolic victories regardless of the consequences. This is why his approach to policy is so dangerous—it is not rooted in principles or guided by evidence but is instead reactionary, impulsive, and, ultimately, self-serving. Even those who praised his tax cuts or deregulatory efforts cannot ignore the fact that his broader economic and foreign policy agenda was unsustainable, unpredictable, and frequently damaging. The contrast with the Biden administration, which has focused on long-term planning, infrastructure investments, and a measured return to diplomacy, reveals a fundamental difference in governance: one that values stability, results, and cooperation, versus one driven by immediate gratification and personal grievance. 

For conservatives who value a stable economy and a consistent, principled foreign policy, it’s clear that Trump’s track record falls far short of what America needs. His impulsive style, disdain for expert advice, and focus on optics over substance have shown that his policies are more about projecting strength than delivering results. A future shaped by Trump’s vision risks deepening division, undermining alliances, and making America’s economic and diplomatic landscape more volatile. In contrast, the Biden administration, despite its flaws, has shown a commitment to rebuilding American strength at home and abroad through practical, well-considered measures. This is not a partisan observation; it’s a matter of who can be trusted to put the country’s interests first and lead with a steady, informed hand.

But I digress - the point is not to make some policy argument against Trump but to dismantle the idea that this celebrity con man should be taken seriously on policy.





# But, *most importantly*, he is an Authoritarian. This is Anti-American in the most fundamental sense
## The people who worked most closely with Trump have been sounding the alarm bells for years
---
I want to shift the attention and focus on a certain subset of leaders that have demonstrated a commitment to the constitution, the interests of this country, and to conservative values. Let's start with Mike Pence. Here's an excerpt from his wiki:
*As governor, Pence initiated the largest tax cut in Indiana's history and pushed for more funding for private education initiatives. He signed bills intended to restrict abortions, including one that prohibited abortions if the reason for the procedure was the fetus's race, gender, or disability, and required funerary services for terminated fetuses, including those resulting from miscarriage...*
So we're talking a real Christian conservative here, which is why Trump picked him as a VP. In that race, he described himself as being "A Christian first, an American second, and a Republican third". *And*, for four years, he loyally served under Trump - and I want to emphaisize that word "loyally". He was 100% behind Trump as VP, until that fateful day. On January 6, he refused to reject a subset of legitimate electors for a set of false electors for Trump. This was the culmination of a months-long effort by Trump to overturn the results of the 2020 election, which *was*, undeniably, free and fair. This was just one part of the broader scheme, which I am more than happy to get into, but the point is that in that moment, Mike Pence held true to the constitution. I cannot imagine a more compelling story than that of the hardcore, Trump-serving Christian conservative now calling him a threat to democracy. But this is not at all to say that there is a shortage of examples here.

Let's talk about General Mark Milley, who served as the Chariman of the Joint Chief of Staff of the Army, which is the principal military advisor to the President, the Secretary of Defense, and the National Security Council. Under Trump, his position was central and consequential in shaping U.S. defense posture and responding to emerging threats. Before serving in this role, he held key leadership positions, and his distinguished career reflects a commitment to duty, leadership under pressure, and a comprehensive knowledge of military strategy and international security dynamics. 
![[Pasted image 20241015211510.png|600]]
So understand that this is a man to be taken seriously, and that we should really listen when he speaks. Not to say that he can't be questioned, but that he is absolutely someone to respect. And what did he say after working for Trump?
> " We don’t take an oath to a tribe. We don’t take an oath to a religion. We don’t take an oath to a king or a queen, or to a tyrant or a dictator. And we don’t take an oath to a wannabe dictator.” Later: "He is the most dangerous person ever... I realize he's a total fascist. He is now the most dangerous person to this country,"

The Trump campaign's response?
> "Woke train-wreck Mark Milley clearly suffers from Trump Derangement Syndrome and it's no surprise he pals around with a washed-up fiction writer like Bob Woodward to peddle lies and misinformation. If Milley spent this much time and effort doing his job, maybe the Afghanistan debacle would have never happened."

Spurred by Kelly, 13 former Trump administration officials last week released [an open letter](https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/9de0033816426a27/e85d475d-full.pdf) amplifying the warnings that Trump would rule like a dictator if he returned to office.

Let's continue down this road, but obviously we can't delve into every single person. Bill Barr, who served as attorney general under George H.W. Bush, and then under Trump from 2019 to 2020, said 
> "The fact of the matter is he is a consummate narcissist and he constantly engages in reckless conduct that puts his political followers at risk and the conservative and Republican agenda at risk. … He will always put his own interest and gratifying his own ego ahead of everything else, including the country’s interest. There’s no question about it. … He’s like a 9-year-old, a defiant 9-year-old kid, who’s always pushing the glass toward the edge of the table defying his parents to stop him from doing it.". 

John Bolton, the veteran national security advisor serving under Trump, said 
> "By the time I left the White House, I was convinced he was not fit to be president. … I think it is a danger for the United States if he gets a second term.”

H.R. McMaster, another one of Trump's national security advisors, said 
> "President Trump and other officials have repeatedly compromised our principles in pursuit of partisan advantage and personal gain.”

Tom Bossert, the homeland security advisor serving under Trump said 
> “This is beyond wrong and illegal. It’s un-American. The president undermined American democracy baselessly for months. As a result, he’s culpable for this siege, and an utter disgrace.” 

John Kelly, Trump's secretary of homeland security and then chief of staff (Trump's longest serving), said Trump is 
> “\[Trump is\] a person who admires autocrats and murderous dictators. A person that has nothing but contempt for our democratic institutions, our Constitution and the rule of law.” 

Mark Esper, Trump's secreary of the Army and then Secretary of Defense said 
> “yes, I do regard him as a threat to democracy, democracy as we know it, our institutions, our political culture, all those things that make America great and have defined us as, you know, the oldest democracy on this planet.” 

James Mattis, a four-star general who served as secretary of defense under Trump, wrote:
> "[Trump was]the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people—does not even pretend to try. Instead, he tries to divide us ... America is witnessing the consequences of three years without mature leadership". 

Mattis called for accountability for "those in office who would make a mockery of our Constitution."

And the list goes on and on. We could get into the broad coalitions of experienced and conservative military and national security leaders, advisors, politicians, etc. who are endorsing Harris[^1], but I think the message is clear. This sort of thing has never happened before in modern American history, with these people are sounding the alarm bells and using *such* dire language. These are the people who saw firsthand how he abused his power, especially in effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election, and hearing everything we've heard since then - his vows of retribution against political enemies, his [targeting of election officials](https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/08/politics/trump-threatens-prosecution-2024-election-officials/index.html), and so on.
> Again I ask - where is the line? What could he possibly do that could make you get out and vote for Kamala Harris?

These actions are, without a doubt, fundamentally anti-American. For all the talk about how Democrats hate the US, there is no comparison to this sort of behavior. It stands entirely against the core values of this country, and it is an absolute disgrace that someone like this still has a decent chance at regaining power. But there is this question that keeps circling around - if there's all this fear around Trump, why didn't he do more damage the first time around? *Is this fear-mongering? Are we over-reacting?* 

Make no mistake, a second Trump term would be fundamentally more destructive than his first. I want to briefly hit that first point again, that even if there are sufficient protections against an anti-American dictator, we still should keep such a person as far from power as possible - that much seems painfully obvious. And Ben Shapiro's argument that "all the damage has been done already" doesn't hold any water whatsoever - not only does it seem to forgive the deep wrongdoings, some of which he acknowledges, but more importantly it is painfully ill-informed. There are very clear reasons why a second term would be fundamentally more damaging than the first.

## A second Trump term would be different
### Trump was **not** given the chance to rule like a dictator in the first term. He *might* in a second.
---
Coming back to John Kelly, Trump's longest-serving chief of staff: he recently warned, very clearly, that Trump would rule like a dictator if given the chance, with the key words *if given the chance*. We need to get a glimpse of what it was actually like working with Trump during his first term and how the people working closest to him worked tirelessly to hold him back from spiraling out of control. Just like before, we're not focusing on statements from politicians or his critics, but rather his closest allies, hand-picked by Trump himself. In 2018, a New York Times op-ed penned by a senior official in the Trump administration noted that “it may be cold comfort in this chaotic era, but Americans should know that there are adults in the room. We fully recognize what is happening. And we are trying to do what’s right even when Donald Trump won’t.” Variations of this message from anonymous insiders have recurred throughout the Trump presidency. In the summer of 2019, a senior national security official told said, “Everyone at this point ignores what the president says and just does their job. The American people should take some measure of confidence in that.”

Both Secretary of Defense James Mattis and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly told officials that they viewed their job as being “babysitter” to the President. Indeed, during Trump’s first year in office Kelly and Mattis reportedly made a pact that at least one of them would stay in the country when Trump was in Washington, just in case he did something crazy. Press accounts are riddled with anonymous staff quotes like “He just seemed to go crazy today” or “He doesn’t really know any boundaries” or “Sometimes he wants to blow everything up.” Kelly once famously remarked that working for Trump was akin to managing “Crazytown". Kelly often found himself intervening in meetings to steer Trump back on track, and several accounts note that he would regularly express exasperation over the President’s tendency to be swayed by the last person who spoke to him, regardless of expertise or qualifications. In the West Wing, it was common for aides to develop strategies to manage Trump’s moods and attention span. Some, like Communications Director Hope Hicks, would keep detailed "mood charts" to track his temperaments, while others would curate flattering media coverage to keep him in good spirits. Advisors would sometimes withhold critical information or delay sharing news they feared would set him off, knowing that even small provocations could trigger a volatile response. One former aide described the President as having “the attention span and temperament of a toddler,” requiring constant management to prevent outbursts. On several occasions, staff would stall or distract him to buy time, knowing that his attention would quickly shift to something else if they could divert his focus. 

Many officials also described the strain of dealing with Trump’s refusal to adhere to norms or facts. He was known for disregarding briefings that did not align with his preconceptions, prompting staff to develop workarounds, like simplifying complex matters into short, visual presentations or repeating key points in different contexts until they stuck. National Security officials were particularly alarmed by his tendency to ignore intelligence assessments in favor of anecdotes or hearsay from informal advisors or cable news. To address this, some aides would carefully tailor their briefings to play to his known biases, making sure that important information was delivered in a way that would capture his attention without provoking anger. The chaos often extended beyond policy decisions to personal interactions, with Trump frequently pitting staff members against each other to create a sense of competition and loyalty. This tactic, which he seemed to enjoy, sowed distrust and dysfunction among his team, with many aides feeling they had to protect their interests while still managing the unpredictable whims of the President. One White House official famously quipped, “It’s like trying to stop a ten-car pile-up, except the cars are on fire, and you’re driving one of them.” This kind of atmosphere contributed to an unprecedented turnover rate, with many key figures leaving the administration burned out or disillusioned by the demands of managing a leader who often seemed uninterested in the complexities of governance.

The accounts of staff members and administration officials from Trump's first term suggest that the stability often attributed to that period was largely the result of efforts to curb his impulsive and erratic tendencies. These officials, many of whom had extensive experience in government or the military, often saw themselves as a buffer between the president's whims and the real consequences of those decisions. This included not only managing his day-to-day impulses but also actively preventing potentially catastrophic decisions. For instance, General H.R. McMaster, who served as National Security Advisor, is said to have structured national security meetings to limit opportunities for the President to make rash, uninformed decisions. His replacement, John Bolton, also clashed frequently with Trump over national security issues, and even he was seen by some insiders as a moderating influence despite his hawkish reputation.

These dynamics underline a critical point: the first term was characterized by a constant struggle to manage Trump’s impulses. Senior figures, who were initially willing to work with him out of a sense of duty or loyalty, often found themselves in the unexpected role of gatekeepers. They saw it as their job to prevent worst-case scenarios, and many burned out or were dismissed when they refused to yield to Trump’s demands. After the first few years, many of these officials resigned or were forced out, often to be replaced by more compliant figures willing to defer to Trump’s judgment without the same level of scrutiny.

This brings us to the difference between a first and potential second term. Trump’s dismissal of advisors who challenged him, and his shift toward appointing loyalists who shared his views, suggests that a second term would likely lack the checks that were in place during his first. The people who remained through the end of his first term, or who have since been elevated in his orbit, are more aligned with Trump’s perspective, less likely to resist questionable decisions, and more focused on loyalty than expertise. This pattern implies that if Trump were to return to office, he would be in a stronger position to surround himself exclusively with allies who might encourage, rather than contain, his more extreme inclinations.

### The Republican party has been transformed into a cult of personality around Trump that demands absolute loyalty to him
---
There has been a seismic shift in the Republican party between 2016 and now. In 2016 it was comparatively normal, and back then you could 100% get away with saying both parties are crazy or that they both represent the same interests, and so on. Back then, there were many reasonable voices speaking out against Trump; former party leaders like Mitt Romney, John McCain, the Bushes, and plenty of senators like Ted Cruz and so on. But today it is unrecognizable. It has transformed into a cult of personality surrounding Trump. Worship him or face exile. Now, The Big Lie of the "stolen 2020 election" has pervaded through the ranks. Everyone from Mike Johnson down to members of the state legislatures and elections boards are attempting to hobble American democracy for the sake of their leader. 

This is one of the most heartbreaking elements of the story - that this enormous group of people who were in theory committed to the constitution are now choosing a power grab over even the most basic democratic ethics. Lindsey Graham initially warned that Trump would "destroy the Republican Party" during the 2016 primaries, but later became one of his staunchest allies, defending his claims of election fraud in 2020. Ted Cruz of Texas famously clashed with Trump during the 2016 primaries, calling him a "pathological liar", later led the charge in Congress to object to the certification of the 2020 election results. Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy initially criticized Trump after the January 6th Capitol attack, but quickly reversed course, visiting Trump at Mar-a-Lago and aligning himself with the narrative that the 2020 election was marred by irregularities. Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, who initially kept his distance from Trump, became a key figure in questioning the election outcome, raising a fist in solidarity with protestors outside the Capitol before the January 6th riots. The list goes on and on, from Mitch McConnel to Ron DeSantis. These are people who hold very real control over the strength of our democracy. 

The transformation of the Republican Party into a personality cult around Trump has not only sidelined dissent but has created a political environment where loyalty to him often supersedes loyalty to core democratic principles. This shift is not merely rhetorical—it has tangible consequences on the functioning of American democracy. Those who deviate from the Trumpian orthodoxy face political obliteration. Former Representative Liz Cheney, once a rising star in the party, lost her leadership position and her primary election after refusing to align with Trump's narrative about the 2020 election. Her fate serves as a warning to other Republicans who might consider prioritizing democratic integrity over allegiance to Trump.

This demand for loyalty extends far beyond elected officials. State-level party organizations have censured or ousted local officials who have criticized Trump or validated the results of the 2020 election. These actions have created a chilling effect, leading to the marginalization or departure of traditional conservatives and moderates within the party. Instead of a coalition with a diverse range of conservative views, the modern Republican Party has narrowed its platform to a single point of loyalty: the unquestioning support of Trump.

As a result, the internal mechanisms of accountability within the party have been weakened. In a healthy political ecosystem, leaders are checked by the diversity of perspectives within their ranks and held accountable by party elders and influential figures. Under Trump’s dominance, that system has eroded. There is no longer a robust faction within the Republican Party that can serve as a counterbalance to extreme positions. Trump's hold over the party makes it clear that a second term would not just be a repeat of his first but a manifestation of unchecked influence, where dissent is punished and sycophancy is rewarded. This is why the comparison to his first term is misleading—because the Trump of 2024 has a party wholly remade in his image, a situation that did not exist in 2016.

This consolidation of power also has profound implications for future elections. Many of the officials who have fallen in line behind Trump are now in positions of authority over election laws and the electoral process. With this groundwork laid, a second Trump administration could rely on a network of loyalists who have openly questioned or undermined the legitimacy of past elections, setting the stage for more significant attempts to manipulate future results. These shifts highlight why arguments that dismiss fears of a second Trump term as "alarmism" miss the deeper structural changes that have occurred. What was once a party with internal diversity and checks now functions more like an apparatus built to serve the interests of a single man.

Furthermore, Trump’s influence over the party has emboldened extremist elements that were previously relegated to the fringes of American politics. Far-right conspiracy theories, once seen as fringe positions, have gained legitimacy within the mainstream Republican discourse. This shift is not limited to a few high-profile controversies but has infected the way the party approaches policy, governance, and American institutions. With this alignment, a second Trump term would not only reflect a continuation of his first but an amplification, given the support structure that now exists within the party to carry out his agenda with fewer barriers and greater coordination.

### Trump has normalized Authoritarian tendencies, numbing us to the severity
---
Trump’s tactics are not new; they are classic moves from an authoritarian playbook. By making increasingly extreme statements and pushing boundaries—whether about pardoning January 6th participants, dismantling civil service protections, or bypassing constitutional norms—he’s gauging public reaction, conditioning his supporters, and wearing down his critics. The danger here is not just in his threats but in how those threats desensitize the public. What might have been a shocking breach of norms a decade ago is now often dismissed as “just Trump being Trump.” This erosion of norms makes it easier for more extreme actions to take root, creating a slippery slope where increasingly authoritarian behavior could become the new normal.

The first term of Donald Trump’s presidency was a period of constant norm-breaking and rule-bending, which, over time, has numbed much of the American public. Each time a new boundary was tested and then crossed, outrage flared but quickly faded, paving the way for the next violation. This pattern of escalating rhetoric and action creates an environment where extreme behavior no longer elicits the same level of alarm, leaving the public less vigilant against real threats. Authoritarianism relies not on a single decisive power grab but on a series of incremental steps, each made possible by a population that becomes gradually accustomed to what would have once been seen as intolerable.

One of the most concerning shifts during Trump’s first term was his insistence on loyalty to himself over loyalty to the Constitution or the rule of law. This was evident in his pressure on institutions to bend to his will and his disdain for oversight, from his attacks on the judiciary to his demands for loyalty from law enforcement. In a potential second term, he would likely double down on purging perceived adversaries and rewarding personal loyalty, leading to the politicization of government institutions that are supposed to serve the public impartially. By normalizing these loyalty tests, he undermines the foundation of a functional democracy, which relies on a system of checks and balances rather than personal allegiances.

Skeptics often argue that since the worst-case scenarios did not materialize in Trump’s first term, fears of authoritarianism are exaggerated. However, the real threat lies in the conditioning of the American public to accept increasingly authoritarian rhetoric. Trump’s continuous undermining of electoral integrity, attacks on the press, and open admiration for autocratic leaders all signal his intentions, which should not be dismissed as mere hyperbole. History shows that authoritarian regimes often rise not through violent coups but through democratic mechanisms that are manipulated by leaders whose goals are openly stated yet ignored. In this context, the fact that “everything seemed fine” during Trump’s first term is not a reassurance but a warning about how close the country already came to more profound democratic erosion. The second term could see the execution of plans he was previously constrained from fully realizing.

### Extremist think tanks, emboldened by Trump's authoritarianism, have been strategizing to expand executive power
---
While the first Trump administration was characterized by a relatively chaotic and improvised style of governance, a second term is unlikely to be as haphazard. In the years since leaving office, a coalition of influential conservative think tanks and policy groups have been quietly and methodically laying the groundwork for a more streamlined and ideologically coherent agenda. Organizations like the Heritage Foundation and the America First Policy Institute have taken Trump’s rhetoric on government overreach, bureaucratic "deep state" conspiracy theories, and executive power to heart, crafting detailed plans for a future presidency that could wield far greater authority.

One of the most notable efforts is "Project 2025," a strategic initiative led by the Heritage Foundation in partnership with several other conservative organizations. This project aims to prepare a detailed blueprint for the first 180 days of a second Trump presidency. Its goal is to provide an incoming administration with a pre-packaged set of policies, legal frameworks, and executive orders that would allow them to take control of key governmental functions swiftly. Project 2025 focuses not only on policy but also on personnel, with an emphasis on filling government agencies with loyalists who share a strong commitment to Trump's vision and are less likely to challenge his authority. This initiative is a stark contrast to Trump’s first term, where many appointees were traditional conservatives who tried to serve as guardrails against some of his more extreme tendencies.

The emphasis of these think tanks is on reasserting executive power and curbing the independence of federal agencies that were perceived as hindrances to Trump’s first-term agenda. One strategy involves a legal theory known as the "unitary executive theory," which suggests that all executive power is vested solely in the President, with minimal checks from Congress or the judiciary. This theory, long championed by conservative legal scholars, would give a future president far greater authority to direct federal agencies and override what he perceives as bureaucratic obstacles. These think tanks are pushing for legal and procedural changes that would make it easier for a president to dismiss federal employees, weaken civil service protections, and tighten political control over the machinery of government.

The America First Policy Institute, another influential organization aligned with Trump’s agenda, has taken steps to shape a second-term administration's approach to areas like immigration, voting rights, and law enforcement. This includes strategies for centralizing power in the White House and stripping authority from career officials in agencies like the Department of Justice and the Environmental Protection Agency. In a second term, this centralization could mean that key decisions would be made by Trump and his most loyal advisors without the usual input from experts or the institutional knowledge of civil servants.

Moreover, think tanks like the Heritage Foundation have been emboldened by what they see as Trump’s willingness to challenge traditional limits on presidential power. Their projects are not just theoretical; they are actively training thousands of conservative operatives, attorneys, and bureaucrats to take on influential roles in a future administration. These efforts are part of a long-term strategy to embed a loyal, ideologically driven network within the government, making it easier to bypass traditional checks and balances. This is an evolution from the first term, where many senior officials viewed themselves as containing Trump’s impulses. A second term could instead feature a government populated by those who see it as their duty to enable, rather than restrain, Trump's more authoritarian instincts.

There's strong reason to believe that the plans laid out by extremist think tanks would be fully embraced and executed by a second Trump administration. In the final months of his first term, Trump issued an executive order known as _Schedule F_, which sought to reclassify thousands of federal civil service positions as political appointees. This change would have made it far easier for the administration to fire and replace career civil servants with loyalists who shared Trump's agenda, removing a significant layer of bureaucratic independence and resistance. Although the order was rescinded by the Biden administration, its issuance was a clear signal that Trump was willing to use legal mechanisms to weaken institutional checks on presidential power.

Trump has repeatedly shown a willingness to break norms and challenge legal boundaries when he perceives institutional resistance. During his first term, he frequently sought to bend agencies to his will, openly expressing frustration when bureaucratic procedures or career officials constrained his actions. From pressuring the Department of Justice to pursue investigations into political rivals, to attempting to leverage the Department of Defense for domestic purposes, Trump demonstrated a pattern of seeking greater executive control. The blueprint provided by groups like the Heritage Foundation would effectively grant him the tools he previously lacked, allowing for a far more structured and legally-backed approach to consolidating power.

These developments suggest that a second Trump administration would be significantly different, not because Trump himself has changed, but because the infrastructure of support around him has grown more sophisticated and organized. The planning undertaken by these think tanks reveals a concerted effort to consolidate power, circumvent institutional safeguards, and limit the independence of agencies that might act as a check on the presidency. This shift from ad-hoc containment to methodical empowerment is a clear indicator that a second Trump term could pose a far greater challenge to democratic norms and the balance of power than his first.





# The lines have all been crossed. Period.
---
Everything that changed between 2020 and today makes an authoritarian takeover so much more likely, but again: even if you think these fears are inflated, which they aren't, we still have the obligation of keeping authoritarians as far from power as possible. Now I could go on, with arguments about his narcissistic personality disorder or lack of understanding of even remotely complex topics. I could expand on how truly terrible his leadership qualities are, or how insane his decision-making process is. We could consider his deranged ramblings which are detatched from reality. We could look more deeply at how he leverages fear and hatred against marginalized groups to rile up his base. In each of these arenas, people are somehow willing to pile on excuses wall to wall, under the arguments that they really only care about policy. This is Ben Shapiro's brilliant line of reasoning - an acknowledgement to some extent that Trump is a very real threat, but that the Dems "have lost their minds" and that Trump, the celebrity con man, will stop their socialist takeover of the US and has these brilliant and nuanced policies that indicate a deep understanding of complex issues. This is entirely unserious, and is a pathetic argument. 

Donald Trump is *absolutely* a threat to this country, and has already damaged our political enviornment substantially. Even *if* he loses, the environment shaped by him will still exist, and I'm not sure how it will get better. 


# Kamala Harris is the obvious and patriotic choice
---
As unfortunate as it is, this election is much more about *preventing* Trump from regaining power than it is about Kamala Harris being elected. There are tons of politicians that would be fine in a moment like this. If there was a sensible Republican going against Trump, I would be just as invested in electing that person. But you need to recognize that Kamala Harris is one of those politicians. **She will be fine.** 

We can all recognize that there are deep issues with the Democratic party, but there more important things at play here. Throughout her career, she has demonstrated a commitment to upholding the Constitution and ensuring that her decisions are guided by principles of justice, accountability, and fairness. While you may not agree with all her policies or positions, Harris has consistently shown a willingness to respect the democratic process, honor the separation of powers, and abide by established legal norms. This contrasts sharply with the increasingly authoritarian tendencies we've seen from Trump.

Contrary to the idea that she is radical, she is actually quite moderate. Consider the fact that she has already committed to putting republicans on her cabinet and has repeatedly spoken in positive terms about the political opposition, and there is a sizeable movement of Republicans endorsing her. This inclusiveness reflects a recognition that durable solutions to America’s challenges require collaboration, not one-sided victories. She understands that unity comes not from imposing one party’s will but from working to achieve consensus, even when it means compromising and listening to opposing viewpoints.

For conservatives, this focus on moderation should be reassuring. Harris is not looking to upend foundational institutions or govern by decree; rather, she seeks to protect the institutions that have made America strong while adapting them to meet the challenges of today. Whether it’s in her law enforcement background, her tenure in the Senate, or her work as Vice President, she has demonstrated a capacity to listen, to engage with opposing viewpoints, and to craft solutions that respect the complexities of governance. A vote for Harris is not a vote for radical change, but for steady leadership that values the Constitution, the rule of law, and a government that serves _all_ Americans.

Moreover, Harris has already shown that she is willing to engage on issues where common ground can be found. Whether it's supporting measures to strengthen national security, improve infrastructure, or bolster job training programs, her focus is on results rather than partisan point-scoring. She has voiced a clear willingness to work across the aisle on issues that matter most to American families, from improving healthcare access to supporting small businesses. For conservatives, the choice is not about endorsing a particular party’s ideology, but about safeguarding the values that unite us as a nation: respect for the Constitution, dedication to the rule of law, and a commitment to working together for the common good.

Kamala Harris is not seeking to lead with an iron fist or impose an unyielding agenda; instead, she aims to restore balance, respect, and civility to the White House. She understands that governing a diverse country requires a willingness to listen, adapt, and find a middle ground. In a time when the stakes are high and the future of our democratic institutions is at risk, Harris's dedication to working with all Americans, regardless of party, should be a key consideration. Her vision is one of inclusion, stability, and a return to the values that have long been at the core of American democracy—values that many conservatives still hold dear.
